# HMS Utils

## Purpose
To persist & share tools I'm using to modify a static HTML site.

## History

* I adopted a site for my kid's preschool.  Was running Wordpress on an old student's parent's server.  I saved the entire site to a folder & re-launched as a static Netlify site. 

* Various content updates have been request & a lot of these require generalized updates & doing them manually would result in errors, so I scripted.

## 7/30

* Updates header to add contact items
* Removes footer.

## TODO
* Lots of unused stuff in html, could use a cleaning.
